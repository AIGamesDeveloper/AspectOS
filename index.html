                    updates for our OS. Before I get into the details, you need to know who we
                    are and what we do.

                            AspectOS is an operating system created by AspectOS Studios. It started
                            out as an individual project but has grown over time. Now we have a team
                            of 35 people! Everybody is committed to making a superior OS. This isn't going to become a real operating system and is actually a realistic mock-up
                            on
                      
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. The operating system was
                            created in May 2021 and was released for BETA testing. At the time, there
                            weren't a lot of apps and it was actually kind of boring. The UI didn't look
                            good and some of the apps didn't function; eventually, it was abandoned
                            and wasn't touched again. Around 4 months later, AspectOS was back again!
                            This time, with a team. The founder created a collaboration and many
                            people joined on the first day! So we got to work and we are currently
                            working on one of the best operating systems on Scratch! From the most
                            advanced apps, such as our
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554613036/">weather app</a>
                            to the most simple apps such as our
                            <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/596876677/"> clicker game</a>,
                            we will make sure you have an experience like no other. As we said, we
                            have many people but more are sure to come and more are sure to have great
                            suggestions for our operating system.
